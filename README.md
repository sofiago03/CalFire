## About
Fire Relief Festival is a fictional non- profit organization dedicated to aiding Northern California residents who have suffered from wildfires. The website encapsulates details of a fictional 3 day long festival where Fire Relief Festival partners with CalFire, California Fire Foundation, Sonoma Ecology Center, and Fire Safe Sonoma. We all partnered up to host different events each day of the event that target specific needs. Those who have suffered from wildfires would need to rebuild their community, or prepare for the possibility of another one. 

## Overview
Using HTML and CSS, I developed this website to be as simple, yet engaging, as possible. I kept in mind the idea that hypothetically people of all ages could use this website, so I stuck with an impactful color scheme and font choice. With playing with scale and font weight, the text should be relatively easy to read for all. None of the images used are too heavily graphic, but are impactful and speak to the tragic occurrences during wildfires.

## Acknowledgment
I would like to thank Professor Joshua Oakley for teaching me almost all of the code that was used to create this website and for pushing me to design in a way that is out of my comfort zone. I would also like to thank [W3Schools ](https://www.w3schools.com/) for helping me troubleshoot my CSS questions when I was outside of class. Most importantly, I would like to dedicate this page as a resource for all victims of wildfires and I hope you all can benefit from some of the resources I mentioned throughout the website.
