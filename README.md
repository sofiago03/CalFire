Fire Relief Festival is a fictional non- profit organization dedicated to aiding Northern California residents who have suffered from wildfires. The website encapusaltes details of a fictional 3 day long festival where Fire Relief Festival partners with CalFire, California Fire Foundation, Sonoma Ecology Center, and Fire Safe Sonoma.
